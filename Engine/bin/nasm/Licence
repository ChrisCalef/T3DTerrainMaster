Terms and Conditions for the use of the Netwide Assembler


=========================================================





Can I have the gist without reading the legalese?


-------------------------------------------------





Basically, NASM is free. You can't charge for it. You can copy it as


much as you like. You can incorporate it, or bits of it, into other


free programs if you want. (But we want to know about it if you do,


and we want to be mentioned in the credits.) We may well allow you


to incorporate it into commercial software too, but we'll probably


demand some money for it, and we'll certainly demand to be given


credit. And in extreme cases (although I can't immediately think of


a reason we might actually want to do this) we may refuse to let you


do it at all.





NASM LICENCE AGREEMENT


======================





By "the Software" this licence refers to the complete contents of


the NASM archive, excluding this licence document itself, and


excluding the contents of the `test' directory. The Netwide


Disassembler, NDISASM, is specifically included under this licence.





I. The Software is freely redistributable; anyone may copy the


Software, or parts of the Software, and give away as many copies as


they like to anyone, as long as this licence document is kept with


the Software. Charging a fee for the Software is prohibited,


although a fee may be charged for the act of transferring a copy,


and you can offer warranty protection and charge a fee for that.





II. The Software, or parts thereof, may be incorporated into other


freely redistributable software (by which we mean software that may


be obtained free of charge) without requiring permission from the


authors, as long as due credit is given to the authors of the


Software in the resulting work, as long as the authors are informed


of this action if possible, and as long as those parts of the


Software that are used remain under this licence.





III. Modified forms of the Software may be created and distributed


as long as the authors are informed of this action if possible, as


long as the resulting work remains under this licence, as long as


the modified form of the Software is distributed with documentation


which still gives credit to the original authors of the Software,


and as long as the modified form of the Software is distributed with


a clear statement that it is not the original form of the Software


in the form that it was distributed by the authors.





IV. The Software, or parts thereof, may be incorporated into other


software which is not freely redistributable (i.e. software for


which a fee is charged), as long as permission is granted from the


authors of the Software. The authors reserve the right to grant this


permission only for a fee, which may at our option take the form of


royalty payments. The authors also reserve the right to refuse to


grant permission if they deem it necessary. For further information


about who exactly the authors are, see clause XI below.





V. The Software may be incorporated, in its original archive form,


into software collections or archives which are not freely


redistributable, as long as it is clearly stated that the Software


itself remains freely redistributable and remains under this licence


and no other. Such collections are deemed not to fall under article


IV of this licence.





VI. Object files or programs generated by the Software as output do


not fall under this licence at all, and may be placed under any


licence the author wishes. The authors explicitly lay no claim to,


and assert no rights over, any programs written by other people and


assembled into object form by the Software.





VII. You may not copy, modify or distribute the Software except


under the terms given in this licence document. You may not


sublicense the Software or in any way place it under any other


licence than this one. Since you have not signed this licence, you


are not of course required to accept it; however, no other licence


applies to the Software, and nothing else grants you any permission


to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Software in any way.


These actions are therefore prohibited if you do not accept this


licence.





VIII. There is no warranty for the Software, to the extent permitted


by applicable law. The authors provide the Software "as is" without


warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not


limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for


a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and


performance of the Software is with you. Should the Software prove


defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or


correction.





IX. In no event, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in


writing, will any of the authors be liable to you for damages,


including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages,


arising out of the use or the inability to use the Software,


including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered


inaccurate or a failure of the Software to operate with any other


programs, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such


damages.





X. In addition to what this Licence otherwise provides, the Software


may be distributed in such a way as to be compliant with the GNU


General Public Licence, as published by the Free Software Foundation,


Cambridge, MA, USA; version 2, or, at your option, any later version;


incorporated herein by reference.  You must include a copy of this


Licence with such distribution.  Furthermore, patches sent to the


authors for the purpose of inclusion in the official release version


are considered cleared for release under the full terms of this


Licence.





XI. The authors of NASM are the original authors (Simon Tatham and


Julian Hall) and all those who the original authors feel have


contributed significantly to the overall project.  If you wish to


contact the authors, Julian Hall (jules@earthcorp.com) should be your


first port of call.





XII. Should any part of this agreement be deemed unenforcable, it is


intended that the remainder of the agreement be held in force.
